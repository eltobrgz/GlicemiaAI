# **App Name**: GlicemiaAI

## Core Features:

- Manual Glucose Logging: Enable manual input of blood glucose readings with time-stamped entries, meal context, and activity notes.
- Glucose Measurement Reminders: Allow configurable, flexible alerts based on personalized schedules. Option to turn individual alerts on/off, with customizable notification sounds.
- Blood Sugar Calendar: Visualize blood sugar readings via a color-coded calendar to highlight trends.
- Insulin Log: Log insulin dosages and types to track medication.
- Insulin Reminders: Setup custom reminders for insulin timing.
- Meal Analysis with Image Recognition: Capture a photo of meals and, using AI image analysis as a tool, estimate nutrients (carbs, proteins, fats), and recommend a potential insulin dosage. The recommendation depends on analysis of food identification, portion sizing, and macronutrient estimation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant purple (#A050BE) to represent health and innovation, reflecting the AI-driven nature of the app.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F5), a desaturated version of the primary, to maintain focus on data and usability.
- Accent color: Teal (#468189), an analogous color, is selected to signal important actions and key data insights, differing significantly in brightness and saturation from the primary color for optimal contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, provides a modern, neutral look, suitable for both headlines and body text. 
- Use simple, clear icons that are easily recognizable, focusing on providing information.
- Employ a clean, card-based layout for data display. Each blood sugar reading and recommendation will appear as a distinct card to make it easy for the user to digest. Prioritize easy access to key features with clear navigation.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions, such as slide-in effects and loading animations, to provide a polished and engaging user experience.
